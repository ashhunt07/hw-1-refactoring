Refactor HTML and CSS with semantic tags


## HW 1 â€“ Code Refactoring

I am refactoring existing code to be more accessible and to meet the standards that were laid out in the the homework readme. I researched some accessibility standards and some helpful ways to make code readable to those who have disabilities, primarily visual. 

While adding in elements for accessiblity I also added in comments throughout the HTML and CSS that will work as visual cues for future developers to either know the purpose of a section or to let them know when a specific code group begins. Hopefully I did this in a way that creates a clear road map to follow while working through these sheets.


## Impressions

The quote that was added to the orginal homework readme:
 
 > Always leave the code you are editing a little cleaner than you found it.

 This concept really stood out to me and I want to keep this in the front of my mind when working through every future assignment. While coding is not a foreign concept to me I do recognize that I have some good habits already as well as some bad habits that I can change know I can improve.

I want to improve my skills and keep in mind that I can always do better and even leave my own code better and a little cleaner than when I first wrote it.
